# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We plan to support security updates from version 8.40.x onwards

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 8.40.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 8.40.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities to: developer@tailormade.com.

We will respond to any reporting issue, individually to the reporting person over e-mail  (changing from developer@tailormade.com to myname@tailormade.com).

We will develop a process on how the vulnerability reported is accepted or declined, etc.  Likely, accepted/fixed issues will be included in the CHANGELOG.md file.
